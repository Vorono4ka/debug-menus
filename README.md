# ~Important info~ No :/
~For this repo I want to thank [daniilnull](https://github.com/daniillnull), [micrdev](https://github.com/MICRDEV) from [OpegitStudio](https://github.com/OpegitStudio) for their help.~ No, that's lie! <br/>
~They described how to call debug menu in [scgdp](https://github.com/OpegitStudio/scgdp).~ That's too.
